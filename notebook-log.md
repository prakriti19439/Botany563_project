#DATA

Species: human, mouse, acomys dimidiatus, acomys russatus, pig, rat, and macaque.
I downloaded the genome-wide soft-masked FASTA files from ensembl. Ex: for rat here is the link: http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-112/fasta/rattus_norvegicus/dna/

#GOAL
I want to construct region level orthology trees to eventually better understand the evolution and role of non-coding regions which are very crucial but understudied compared to genes. These region trees for example, can be used in downstream analysis with multi-species multiome data to understand Compensatory Renal Growth in kidney.

There is no QC required as such I believe because these are widely used FASTA downloaded from ensembl. But if need be, I found https://busco.ezlab.org/ busco tool interesting.
